# taxed

This project lets you generate 2016 taxes for various incomes, filing status and number of children. Only CA and federal taxes are calculated. The shiny app is hosted at http://speakempirics.com/taxed/ 

There's also a blog post, that goes along with the shiny app: http://medium.com/what??

If you want to play with output of this engine, see marriage_or_divorce.Rmd for examples of how to call the get_data function.
